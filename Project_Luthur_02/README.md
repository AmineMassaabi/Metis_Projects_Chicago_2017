This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for Project Luthur of the Metis Data Science Bootcamp - Chicago Summer 2017.

The order of the notebooks below, follow my general train of throught and process throughout this project. 

- Web_scraping_notebook.ipynb - This notebook contains the code that I used to scrape Rotton Tomatoes.

- Wikipedia_API_scraping.ipynb - This notebook contains code that interfaced with Wikipedia's API in order to obtain wikipedia.page. These objects then allowed me to access the unique URL's for each movie.

- Extracting_infobox.ipynb - This notebook contains code that traversed through all of the wikipedia.page objects, navigated to unique movie URL's and then extracted their respective infobox's. An infobox is usually a short summary of key information on the right hand side of a wikipedia page.

- Dataframe_construction_notebook.ipynb - This notebook contains code that was used to do a final clean up of my data before it was ready to be placed in a dataframe. This was the last stage of date cleaning/prep before I started my analysis.

- Model_Creation_and_Analysis.ipynb - This notebook contains the final models and analysis for this project.

Additional files:

- grid.py - this file contains all the code used in the construction of my Linear Models.

- imports.py - this file contains imports to libraries I often use. This just saves me tyoing common libraries in jupyter.

- helper_functions.py - this file contains helper functions I wrote to speed up common tasks

The focus of this project was data cleaning/munging(ETL) in addition to a first pass ar simple linear regression models using the sklearn library.
