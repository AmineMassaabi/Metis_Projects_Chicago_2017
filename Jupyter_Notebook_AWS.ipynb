    "Since we are **NOT** installing the anaconda distribution, you should install all the packaged you require via `pip`/`pip3`. If you do this ahead of time, your jupyter notebook will be ready to run all of your favourite packages at the end of this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, complete the following **first**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `pip3` installed on your ubuntu machine\n",

    "### LET'S BEGIN!\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Note: `$:` represents the terminal prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Create a password for your Jupyter Notebook - remember this, you will need it later!\n",
    "\n",
    "In your terminal, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `$: ipython`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `$: from IPython.lib import passwd`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `$: passwd()`\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you will enter a password of your choice. Twice. Be sure to remember this password.\n",
    "\n",
    "After entering your password twice, the interpreter will output a **_hashed_** version of your entered password. It will start with *`'sha1:`*\n",
    "\n",
    "**COPY THIS HASHED PASSWORD AND PASTE IN SOMEWHERE FOR EASY ACCESS. YOU WILL NEED THIS LATER.**\n",
    "\n",
    "> `$: exit`\n",

    "#### 2. Create a Jupyter Config File\n",
    "\n",
    "> `$: jupyter notebook --generate-config`\n",
    "\n",
    "The above command will generate the default jupyter notebook configuration file. Don't worry, this wont change anything as all the configurations in this file have been hashed out!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will now be adding some of our own configurations to this file to make our notebook integrate with AWS.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before that, we have to add some security certificates!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Security certificates!\n",
    "\n",
    "In your *ROOT* directory i.e. `~$` type the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "> `$: mkdir certificates`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `$: cd certificates`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `$: sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout notebook_certificate.pem -out notebook_certificate.pem`\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, you will see a series of questions appear on your terminal. These questions are required for creating a _unique_ certificate for you (i.e. the user). Just answer the questions as stated on the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.: Provide the initials (2) of your country of residence [AU]: US <-- if you lived in the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: It does not matter if you make a mistake in answering any of the questions! We jsut need to answer these questions to generate a security certificate**\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have answered the questions, you should be back in your root directory!\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, type `pwd`. Copy the output - this is the file location of your certificate. We will need this path later.\n",

    "The text you copy should look something like this: \n",

    "> `/home/igabr/certificates/notebook_certificate.pem`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Configure Jupyter\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "> `$: cd ~/.jupyter/`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `$: nano jupyter_notebook_config.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should now see the jupyter notebook configuration file opened in the nano text editor. There is **LOTS** of text that is hashed out in this file. No need to be intimidated! We are just going to add a few lines of **UNHASHED** text to this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enter the following in jupyter_notebook_config.py:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    ">`c = get_config()`\n",
    "\n",
    ">`c.IPKernelApp.pylab = 'inline'  # This enables %matplotlib inline by default`\n",

    "> `c.NotebookApp.certfile = u'PATH TO CERTIFICATE HERE'`\n",

    "> `c.NotebookApp.ip = '*'`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False`\n",
    "\n",
    "> `c.NotebookApp.password = u'HASHED PASSWORD HERE'`  \n",
    "\n",
    "> `c.NotebookApp.port = 8888 #JUST LIKE WE SET IN AWS`\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have typed in the above lines, we need to save and exit the nano editor. Do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "`control + o`\n",
    "\n",
    "`press enter`\n",
    "\n",
    "`control + x`\n",
