I was with Metis during the Summer of 2017. After Metis, I returned to complete my final year in [Graduate School](https://capp.cs.uchicago.edu/) @ The University of Chicago.

You can find my blog [here](https://ibrahimgabr.com/blog).

The two projects I am most proud of:

- [Content Based Twitter Recommendation Engine](https://github.com/igabr/Metis_Projects_Chicago_2017/tree/master/04-Project-Fletcher)
- [Algorithmic Trading using Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/igabr/Metis_Projects_Chicago_2017/tree/master/05-project-kojack)
